The augmented reality assignemnt for the module VR and AR where the goal was to make a simple AR application for children during university open days in one of several themes. 

I decided to theme my game around Issac Newton due to that being the name of the university building the work was primarily completed in and included multiple spacial relative mechanics in an augmented reality mobile app developed in unity. 

Module grade: 69 / 100
